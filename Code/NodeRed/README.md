<h1>Node-red -> Mosquitto -> Arduino </h1>
<p> This is still a work in progress</p>
<p> At this point what i got woriking is that the ESP8266 sends JSON objects to node red with the temperature, ip addres mac addres and the RSSI(wifi range).</p>
<p> Next thing on the list is to be able to send the JSON object to the ESP8266 that contains the value to change the brightness of the LED.</p>
